#Portfolio_Project

##What is the purpose of the portfolio project?

Portfolio project is the second project which forms part of Udacity's full stack nano degree. The project is designed to display my understanding of html, css, and frameworks such as bootstrap. I have made sure that the page is responsive and that all information is displayed over different devices such as a nexus5, ipad and a laptop or desktop. I am sure in the future this page will be reworked to add all work during the course.

##Installation

As `index.html` is a _basic html_ page, installation is simple. All that is required to view `index.html` is to have _Chrome web browser_ installed, this is so that `index.html` can be viewed using the _developer tools_. _Chrome_ can be installed on _Mac os and windows/Linux_.
