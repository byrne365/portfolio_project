portfolio_project

What is the purpose of the portfolio project?

Portfolio project is the second project which forms part of Udacity's full stack nano degree. The project is designed to display my understanding of html, css, and frameworks such as bootstrap. I have made sure that the page is responsive and that all information is displayed over different devices such as a nexus5, ipad and a laptop or desktop. I am sure in the future this page will be reworked to add all work during the course.
